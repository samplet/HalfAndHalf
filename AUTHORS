Authors of HalfAndHalf

HalfAndHalf is based on the CSharpCream project written by Ali Hmer.
CSharpCream, in turn, is based on the original Cream, written in Java by
Naoyuki Tamura.

See <http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hmer200a/> for CSharpCream, and
<http://bach.istc.kobe-u.ac.jp/cream/> for Cream.

The original modifications made to CSharpCream to create HalfAndHalf were
made by Timothy Sample, who currently maintains the project.
